# Mr Nom for Android Studio 1.5.1

This is the example game from Chapter 6 of Beginning Android Games, 2nd edition, by Mario Zechner and Robert Green.
The original version was intended for Eclipse+ADT. This version has been restructured to be compiled by Android Studio 1.5.1.
The Java code itself is exactly as in the book.
